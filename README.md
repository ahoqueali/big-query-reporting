# Designing Data Systems AI Can Trust: A Three‑Layer Approach


I’ve been exploring a practical approach for making enterprise data truly **AI‑ready** — by structuring it into three distinct layers that give AI the context it needs to *reason*, not just *query*.

## 🔹 **Ontology** — defines the core business concepts  
## 🔹 **Semantic Model** — defines how those concepts are measured  
## 🔹 **Data Model** — defines how the data is physically stored

This separation isn’t just good modelling practice — **it’s what makes AI effective**.

---

## Why This Matters for AI‑Ready Systems

Most organisations expect AI to answer business questions directly from natural language. But AI can only do that reliably if it has structured knowledge at each layer:

- **Ontology** — tells AI what business terms mean  
- **Semantic model** — tells AI how to calculate things  
- **Data model** — tells AI where the data lives  

Without these layers, AI is forced to guess — often incorrectly — from raw schemas, inconsistent definitions, or tribal knowledge.

## What an AI‑Ready Architecture Enables

When someone asks:

> *“Average monthly revenue from new customers in Europe over the last 12 months”*

An AI‑ready system can:

- Interpret **“new customer”**, **“revenue”**, and **“Europe”** using the **ontology**  
- Map the question to measures, dimensions, filters, and time logic via the **semantic model**  
- Generate accurate SQL using the **data model**  

This means AI can do more than produce a query — it can:

- Explain its reasoning  
- Apply business rules consistently  
- Deliver answers people trust  


A minimal, working example of an AI data system, all defined in YAML. The layers separate *what things mean* from *how they're queried* from *how they're stored*.

```
ontology/           <- conceptual layer: entities, properties, relationships, rules
semantic_models/    <- business layer: dimensions, measures, metrics (dbt/MetricFlow style)
data_model/         <- physical layer: DuckDB table schemas (columns, types, partitioning)
generated_ddl/      <- output of generate_ddl.py (DuckDB DDL, regenerated on demand)
scripts/
  generate_ddl.py       <- data_model/*.yaml -> generated_ddl/*.sql
  validate_mapping.py   <- checks ontology -> semantic -> data_model references are consistent
  duckdb_mcp_server.py  <- MCP server exposing DuckDB over stdio for opencode
data.duckdb         <- local DuckDB database (auto-seeded from generated_ddl/)
opencode.json       <- opencode config with DuckDB MCP server
```

---

## Why DuckDB?

DuckDB is used in this project because:

- **Zero infrastructure** — no cloud account, no `bq` CLI, no credentials; just a local file (`data.duckdb`)
- **Instant iteration** — DDL changes and queries run in milliseconds, not the seconds-to-minutes of remote warehouse round-trips
- **Reproducible** — anyone can clone the repo and run the full stack with `pip install duckdb pyyaml && python scripts/generate_ddl.py`
- **Same SQL dialect** — DuckDB's SQL is a strict superset of BigQuery's; migration back to BigQuery later requires only a DDL translation step
- **No throughput billing** — BigQuery charges $5 per TB scanned; without well-designed partitioning and clustering, a naive `SELECT *` on a large table can rack up significant costs. DuckDB is free and runs entirely on your machine, so ad-hoc exploration and repeated dev queries cost nothing regardless of how the data is organized

---

## The Three Layers

The dependency flows in one direction:

```
Ontology  --maps to-->  Semantic Model  --built on-->  Data Model  --lives in-->  DuckDB
```

| Layer | Question it answers | Changes how often | Owned by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ontology** | What *is* a Customer, an Account — and how do they relate? | Rarely | Domain experts, data architects |
| **Semantic model** | What metrics and dimensions can I query? | Occasionally | Analytics engineers |
| **Data model** | What tables, columns, and types physically exist? | Frequently | Data engineers |

---

## 1. Ontology Layer

The conceptual description of business entities, their properties, relationships, and business rules — independent of any database or query language. This is the most stable layer; systems change but the underlying business concepts stay true.

Each entity YAML contains:

- **Entity** and description
- **Properties** — typed attributes (e.g. `hasBalance: Money`)
- **Relationships** — how entities connect, with cardinality (e.g. one Customer holds many Accounts)
- **Rules** — constraints, integrity checks, and derivations (e.g. `balance_after = balance_before + amount`)
- **`maps_to`** — pointers to the semantic model (entity, dimensions, measures)

### Entities

| Entity | Table | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Customer | `core.customer` | A party who has signed up and may hold Accounts and Mortgages |
| SavingAccount | `core.saving_account` | A deposit account that earns interest |
| CurrentAccount | `core.current_account` | A transactional account for everyday spending |
| MortgageAccount | `core.mortgage_account` | A secured loan used to finance a real estate purchase |
| Transaction | `core.transaction` | A financial event that debits or credits an Account balance |

### Example: Customer Ontology

```yaml
entity: Customer
description: "A party who has signed up and may hold Accounts and Mortgages"
properties:
  - name: hasRegion
    range: Region
    description: "The sales region the customer belongs to"
  - name: hasLifetimeValue
    range: Money
    description: "Cumulative revenue attributed to this customer"
  - name: hasStatus
    range: ActiveStatus
    description: "Whether the customer is currently active"
rules:
  - name: hasAtLeastOneAccount
    description: "A Customer must hold at least one Account"
    type: integrity
    expression: "Customer[customer_id] implies exists SavingAccount[customer_id] or exists CurrentAccount[customer_id] or exists MortgageAccount[customer_id]"
  - name: requiresActiveStatusForPositiveLtv
    description: "A Customer with a positive lifetime value must be active"
    type: constraint
    expression: "lifetime_value > 0 implies is_active = true"
maps_to:
  semantic_model: customer
  entity: customer
  dimensions: [region, is_active]
  measures: [lifetime_value, customer_count]
```

### Rules by Entity

| Entity | Rule | Type | Expression |
|---|---|---|---|
| Customer | `hasAtLeastOneAccount` | integrity | Must hold at least one account |
| Customer | `requiresActiveStatusForPositiveLtv` | constraint | Positive LTV implies active |
| SavingAccount | `nonNegativeBalance` | constraint | Balance >= 0 |
| SavingAccount | `validInterestRate` | constraint | Rate between 0 and 1 |
| SavingAccount | `interestAccrual` | derivation | `daily_interest = balance * rate / 365` |
| CurrentAccount | `overdraftBound` | constraint | Balance >= -overdraft_limit |
| CurrentAccount | `debitCardRequiresActive` | constraint | Debit card implies active status |
| CurrentAccount | `overdraftRequiresInterestRate` | constraint | Overdraft limit requires interest rate |
| MortgageAccount | `outstandingWithinLoan` | constraint | Outstanding <= loan_amount |
| MortgageAccount | `positiveInterestRate` | constraint | Rate > 0 |
| MortgageAccount | `maturityAfterOrigination` | constraint | Maturity > origination date |
| MortgageAccount | `amortizationSchedule` | derivation | Standard amortization formula |
| Transaction | `nonZeroAmount` | constraint | Amount != 0 |
| Transaction | `accountingIdentity` | derivation | `balance_after = balance_before + amount` |
| Transaction | `signByType` | constraint | Deposits positive, withdrawals negative |
| Transaction | `postsToExactlyOne` | integrity | Posts to exactly one account type |

## 2. Semantic Model Layer

The business-facing abstraction over physical tables — the metrics, dimensions, and relationships that analysts and BI tools actually query. Uses dbt MetricFlow YAML syntax.

Each semantic model YAML contains:

- **Model** — `ref('table')` linking to the data model
- **Entities** — primary and foreign keys (for joins)
- **Dimensions** — categorical or time attributes for filtering/grouping
- **Measures** — raw aggregations (sum, count, avg, etc.)

And a top-level **Metrics** section for named, reusable business calculations.

### Semantic Models and Metrics

**customer**

| Metric | Description | Based on |
|---|---|---|
| `total_ltv` | Total lifetime value across all customers | `sum(lifetime_value)` |
| `active_customers` | Count of active customers | `count_distinct(customer_id)` where `is_active = true` |

**current_account**

| Metric | Description | Based on |
|---|---|---|
| `total_current_balance` | Total balance across all current accounts | `sum(balance)` |
| `total_current_accounts` | Total number of current accounts | `count_distinct(current_account_id)` |
| `avg_current_account_balance` | Average balance per current account | `avg(balance)` |

**saving_account**

| Metric | Description | Based on |
|---|---|---|
| `total_saving_balance` | Total balance across all savings accounts | `sum(balance)` |
| `total_saving_accounts` | Total number of savings accounts | `count_distinct(saving_account_id)` |
| `avg_saving_account_balance` | Average balance per savings account | `avg(balance)` |

**mortgage_account**

| Metric | Description | Based on |
|---|---|---|
| `total_mortgage_balance` | Total outstanding mortgage balance | `sum(outstanding_balance)` |
| `total_mortgages` | Total number of mortgage accounts | `count_distinct(mortgage_account_id)` |
| `total_originated_volume` | Total original loan amount | `sum(loan_amount)` |
| `avg_mortgage_rate` | Average interest rate across mortgages | `avg(interest_rate)` |

**transaction**

| Metric | Description | Based on |
|---|---|---|
| `total_volume` | Total transaction volume | `sum(amount)` |
| `total_transactions` | Total number of transactions | `count(transaction_id)` |
| `net_cash_flow` | Net cash flow (credits minus debits) | `sum(amount)` |
| `withdrawal_volume` | Total amount withdrawn | `sum(amount)` where `transaction_type = 'withdrawal'` |

### Example: Customer Semantic Model

```yaml
semantic_models:
  - name: customer
    model: ref('customer')
    entities:
      - name: customer
        type: primary
        expr: customer_id
    dimensions:
      - name: region
        type: categorical
      - name: signup_date
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
      - name: is_active
        type: categorical
    measures:
      - name: lifetime_value
        agg: sum
      - name: customer_count
        agg: count_distinct
        expr: customer_id

metrics:
  - name: total_ltv
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure: lifetime_value
  - name: active_customers
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure: customer_count
    filter: |
      {{ Dimension('customer__is_active') }} = true
```

## 3. Data Model Layer

The physical structure of your data in DuckDB — table names, column names, types, partitioning, and clustering. This YAML is compiled into `CREATE TABLE` DDL.

Each data model YAML contains:

- **Table/dataset/project** — fully qualified DuckDB table reference
- **Partitioning** — date column for partition pruning (cost and performance)
- **Clustering** — columns for optimized filtering/joining
- **Columns** — name, DuckDB type (`STRING`, `NUMERIC`, `DATE`, `BOOL`, `INT64`), mode (`REQUIRED`/`NULLABLE`), description

### Tables

| Table | Columns | Partitioned by | Clustered by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core.customer` | customer_id, signup_date, region, lifetime_value, is_active | signup_date | region, customer_id |
| `core.current_account` | current_account_id, customer_id, balance, currency, overdraft_limit, overdraft_interest_rate, has_debit_card, opened_date, status | opened_date | customer_id, overdraft_limit |
| `core.saving_account` | saving_account_id, customer_id, balance, currency, interest_rate, minimum_balance, opened_date, status | opened_date | customer_id, interest_rate |
| `core.mortgage_account` | mortgage_account_id, customer_id, property_address, property_value, loan_amount, outstanding_balance, currency, interest_rate, interest_rate_type, loan_term_months, monthly_payment, origination_date, maturity_date, status | origination_date | customer_id, status |
| `core.transaction` | transaction_id, account_id, transaction_type, amount, currency, balance_before, balance_after, description, transaction_date, status | transaction_date | account_id, transaction_type |

### Example: Customer Data Model

```yaml
table: customer
dataset: core
project: your_gcp_project
partition_by:
  field: signup_date
  type: DATE
cluster_by: [region, customer_id]
columns:
  - name: customer_id
    type: STRING
    mode: REQUIRED
    description: "Primary key"
  - name: signup_date
    type: DATE
    mode: REQUIRED
  - name: region
    type: STRING
    mode: NULLABLE
  - name: lifetime_value
    type: NUMERIC
    mode: NULLABLE
  - name: is_active
    type: BOOL
    mode: NULLABLE
```

### How Layers Connect (Customer example)

1. **Ontology** says: *"A Customer has a lifetime value."* (stable business fact)
2. **Semantic model** says: *"`lifetime_value` is a `sum` measure; `total_ltv` is the metric analysts query."* (governed definition)
3. **Data model** says: *"`lifetime_value` is a `NUMERIC` column in `core.customer`, clustered by `region`."* (physical reality)

If a column is renamed or a table migrated, only the data model and its direct semantic mapping change — the ontology and metric names stay untouched.

---

## Files by Layer

| Entity | Ontology | Semantic Model | Data Model | DDL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Customer | `ontology/customer.yaml` | `semantic_models/customer.yml` | `data_model/customer.yaml` | `generated_ddl/customer.sql` |
| SavingAccount | `ontology/saving_account.yaml` | `semantic_models/saving_account.yml` | `data_model/saving_account.yaml` | `generated_ddl/saving_account.sql` |
| CurrentAccount | `ontology/current_account.yaml` | `semantic_models/current_account.yml` | `data_model/current_account.yaml` | `generated_ddl/current_account.sql` |
| MortgageAccount | `ontology/mortgage_account.yaml` | `semantic_models/mortgage_account.yml` | `data_model/mortgage_account.yaml` | `generated_ddl/mortgage_account.sql` |
| Transaction | `ontology/transaction.yaml` | `semantic_models/transaction.yml` | `data_model/transaction.yaml` | `generated_ddl/transaction.sql` |

## Installing opencode

### Quick Install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

This installs opencode to `~/.opencode/bin/opencode`. Add it to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.opencode/bin:$PATH"
```

### Alternative Methods

**npm:**
```bash
npm install -g @opencode-ai/cli
```

**Homebrew:**
```bash
brew install opencode
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
opencode --version
```

For full documentation, visit [opencode.ai/docs](https://opencode.ai/docs).

## Querying with DuckDB via opencode

### Setup

```bash
pip install duckdb pyyaml --break-system-packages
```

### Generate DDL

```bash
python scripts/generate_ddl.py
```

This reads `data_model/*.yaml` and produces `generated_ddl/*.sql` (DuckDB DDL).

### Validate Layer Consistency

```bash
python scripts/validate_mapping.py
```

Checks that all `maps_to` references in the ontology resolve to existing semantic model dimensions/measures, and that semantic model expressions resolve to existing data model columns. Run this in CI on every PR that touches any model layer.

### Start the MCP Server (opencode)

The DuckDB MCP server is configured in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "duckdb": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["python3", "scripts/duckdb_mcp_server.py"],
      "enabled": true,
      "env": {
        "DUCKDB_PATH": "data.duckdb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When you launch opencode in this project, the MCP server starts automatically. It:

1. Opens (or creates) the DuckDB database at `data.duckdb`
2. On first connect, auto-seeds tables from `generated_ddl/*.sql` — converting DuckDB types to DuckDB equivalents (STRING→VARCHAR, NUMERIC→DECIMAL, BOOL→BOOLEAN, etc.)
3. Exposes a `run_query` tool over stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0, MCP protocol `2024-11-05`)

### Query via opencode

Once the MCP server is running, ask opencode to run SQL against the database. Examples:

```
Show me all customers in the NA region
```

```
What is the total outstanding mortgage balance by status?
```

```
Run a query: SELECT customer_id, count(*) as account_count
FROM core.current_account GROUP BY customer_id
```

Under the hood, opencode calls the `run_query` tool:

```json
{
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM core.customer WHERE region = 'NA'",
  "max_results": 100
}
```

The tool returns JSON with `columns`, `rows`, `row_count`, and `truncated`.

### Query Directly (without opencode)

```python
import duckdb
conn = duckdb.connect('data.duckdb', read_only=True)
result = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM core.customer LIMIT 5").fetchall()
conn.close()
```

## How the LLM Uses the Three Layers

When you ask opencode a question like *"What's the total mortgage balance by region?"*, the LLM doesn't just guess at SQL — it reasons through the three layers to construct a correct, meaningful query.

### Step 1: Ontology — Understand the Business Concept

The LLM reads the ontology files to understand what entities exist and how they relate:

- "mortgage balance" maps to the `MortgageAccount` entity
- `MortgageAccount` has an `outstanding_balance` property and is held by a `Customer` (many-to-one)
- `Customer` has a `hasRegion` property

This tells the LLM that mortgages and customers are separate entities joined by `customer_id`, not the same table.

### Step 2: Semantic Model — Find the Right Metric

The LLM reads the semantic model to find the governed metric definitions:

- `mortgage_account` semantic model has an `outstanding_balance` measure (`sum` of `outstanding_balance`)
- `customer` semantic model has a `region` dimension and a `customer` foreign key entity

This tells the LLM which aggregation to use (`sum`), which column to aggregate, and that it needs to join `mortgage_account` to `customer` to get `region`.

### Step 3: Data Model — Write Correct SQL

The LLM reads the data model to get the exact physical schema:

- `core.mortgage_account` has columns `customer_id` (STRING) and `outstanding_balance` (NUMERIC)
- `core.customer` has columns `customer_id` (STRING) and `region` (STRING)

This gives the LLM the exact table names, column names, and join keys to write:

```sql
SELECT c.region, sum(m.outstanding_balance) AS total_outstanding
FROM core.mortgage_account m
JOIN core.customer c ON m.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.region
```

### Step 4: Execute via MCP

The LLM calls the `run_query` tool with the SQL, gets back the results, and presents them to you in natural language.

### Why This Matters

| Without the layers | With the layers |
|---|---|
| LLM guesses at table/column names — often wrong | LLM reads exact schema from data model YAML |
| LLM invents its own metric definitions | LLM uses governed metrics from semantic model |
| LLM doesn't understand entity relationships | LLM knows from ontology that mortgages belong to customers |
| Results may be semantically incorrect | Results match the business definitions |

The three layers give the LLM a **grounded, structured understanding** of your data domain — not just raw schema introspection, but the *meaning* behind tables and columns.

---

## Extending

- **More tables**: add a YAML file to `data_model/`, a matching block to `semantic_models/`, and an entity to `ontology/` with a `maps_to` pointing at it.
- **Formal ontology**: treat `ontology/*.yaml` as a lightweight bridge and maintain the canonical ontology in OWL/RDF (e.g. via Protege).
- **Other semantic engines**: the MetricFlow syntax also maps to Cube's schema format or Malloy source/view definitions.
- **Drift detection**: extend `validate_mapping.py` to query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` and diff against `data_model/*.yaml`.
